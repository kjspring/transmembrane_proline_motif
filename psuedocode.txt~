Pseudocode

Algorithm.

1. Take the database file
2. Convert the database file into a BioPython data class.
3. Make a new class that inherits the BioPython class but adds transmembrane sequence locations and whether it is a multi or single pass integral membrane protein.
	A.) Search the class sequence variables and find only areas that are transmembrane domains.
		1.) Search every 20 amino acid and calculate the total Kyte-Doolittle Hydrophobicity score.
		2.) if (kd > 0) hydrophilic
		3.) if (kd < 0) hydrophobic and thus a transmembrane region.

	B.) Annotate the proteins and list if they are multi- or single-pass integral membrane proteins.
