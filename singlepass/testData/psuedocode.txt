Pseudocode

Algorithm.

1. Take the database file
2. Convert the database file into a BioPython data class.
3. Make a new class that is derived from the BioPython class and inherits all its member data but adds transmembrane sequence locations and whether it is a multi or single pass integral membrane protein.
	A.) Search the class sequence variables and find only areas that are transmembrane domains.
		1.) Search every 20 amino acid and calculate the total Kyte-Doolittle Hydrophobicity score.
		2.) if (kd > 0) hydrophilic
		3.) if (kd < 0) hydrophobic and thus a transmembrane region.
			a) Keep track of the transmembrane areas with an array, every even index is where the TMD starts and the even index is where it stops in the amino acid sequence.
			b) single-pass = 0, multi-pass = 1

	B.) Annotate the proteins and list if they are multi- or single-pass integral membrane proteins.
		1.) Look into the BioPython class SeqFeature (4.3)
